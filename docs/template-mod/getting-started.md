JamCore has made efforts to make its template mod tooling available for others to use, as a lot of time has gone into them.

Our template mod:

- is automatically tested via GitHub CI (as well as including GitHub CI for the generated mod),
- can be initialized quickly using a custom CLI,
- supports Forge, NeoForge, Fabric, and Quilt via Architectury,
- comes with [JamLib](/jamlib/getting-started) included (although this can quite easily be removed),
- is well documented.

## Using the Template

## What Next?

In short, start modding! We have also made some other tutorials here covering common use cases:

- [Adding an access widener](/template-mod/access-wideners)
- [Using a 'fabric-like' subproject](/template-mod/fabric-like-subproject)
- [Adding platform specific mixins](/template-mod/platform-specific-mixins)
- [Using [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras)](/template-mod/mixin-extras)
- [Adding a test mod](/template-mod/test-mod)
- [Publishing to a Maven repository](/template-mod/maven-repository)
- [Publishing to GitHub, Modrinth, and Curseforge automatically](/template-mod/publishing)
