JamCore has made efforts to make its template mod tooling available for others to use, as a lot of time has gone into them.

Our template mod:

- is automatically tested via GitHub CI (as well as including GitHub CI for the generated mod),
- can be initialized quickly using a custom CLI,
- supports Forge, NeoForge, Fabric, and Quilt via Architectury,
- comes with [JamLib](/jamlib/getting-started) included (although this can quite easily be removed),

## Using the Template

## What Next?

In short, start modding! Updates to this documentation with specific tutorials will be made as and when I use the features - when I implement a test mod into one of my mods, I will document it here for future reference, for example.

The [JamLib GitHub repository](https://github.com/JamCoreModding/jamlib) is a useful reference as it uses this template while extending it with features such as Maven publishing and a test mod sourceset.
