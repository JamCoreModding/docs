> Automated recipe serializers for a more painless data driven experience.

Auto Recipe is a library that creates recipe serializers for you based on
annotations, removing a lot of the boilerplate of creating custom recipe types.

Jam Core's fork of Auto Recipe is an updated version of the original,
unmaintained, version of Auto Recipe, created with consent from the original
author, [Emi](https://github.com/emilyploszaj).

## Features

- Support for the latest Minecraft versions.
- Compatibility with the Quilt Recipe API for enhanced debugging features.
- Out of the box support for serialization of common types, including all Java
  primatives, lists, maps, and commonly used Minecraft classes.
- Support for custom serializers, allowing you to serialize any type you want.
