- ❌: **No** support at all - versions may exist for this Minecraft version, but
  they will not be updated.
- 💤: New updates won't be backported, but issues **may** be fixed.
- ✅: Full active support. New updates will come to this version.
- 🚧: In progress or planned.

With the exception of Utility Belt, critical issues _might_ still be fixed on
unsupported versions - this applies to my more popular mods. Please report the
issue on GitHub, but do not be surprised if it is closed.

- **\*1**: Accessories does not support this version, so Utility Belt is unavailable for it.

- **\*2**: I can no longer reproduce this error on newer versions, so the mod is
discontinued. If you can reproduce the error reliably, please let me know.

_Any mods not listed in this table are likely discontinued. If unsure, feel free
to reach out via Discord._
