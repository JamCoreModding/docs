RightClickHarvest is _the_ solution for right-click-to-harvest mods on Fabric
and Quilt. It supports regular crop harvesting, as well as sugarcane, cocoa
beans, and similar non-conventional crops. Crops added by other mods need no
extra configuration to be supported, unlike other right-click-to-harvest mods.

RightClickHarvest also supports advanced features such as using hunger to
harvest, requiring a hoe to be held, and harvesting in a greater radius
depending on the hoe used - all of which are toggleable.
