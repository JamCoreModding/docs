RightClickHarvest is _the_ solution for right-click-to-harvest mods on Fabric, Quilt, and Forge. It supports regular crop harvesting, as well as sugarcane, cocoa
beans, and similar non-conventional crops. Crops added by other mods need no
extra configuration to be supported, unlike other right-click-to-harvest mods.

RightClickHarvest also supports other configurable features such as:

- Using hunger to harvest,
- Requiring a hoe to be held,
- Harvesting in a greater radius depending on the tier of hoe used.
